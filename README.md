Proof of concept of a Ruby on Rails application site. Plan to use it to prototype a couple of Site ideas and determine possible opportunities.

are present
   sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
   sudo apt-get install nodejs # *Or the desired javascript runtime*

Once the required libraries are installed just run
  bundle
